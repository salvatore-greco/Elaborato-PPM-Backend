Event Management System: Build an event management system where users can create,manage, and attend events. Implement
features such as event creation, event registration, and event attendance tracking. The model complexity can involve
defining relationships between users, events, and registrations. The templates can focus on displaying event details and
attendee information. Define two user groups with distinct permissions: Attendee that can view events,
register/unregister themselves, view own registrations; Organizer that has all attendee permissions, plus create,
update, and delete their own events and view list of attendees for their events.
